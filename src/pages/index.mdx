## I design and develop websites that turn visitors into customers.

Based in Bolton, I became involved in website design and development whilst studying Design and Interactive media. Since leaving education in 2008 I have built websites for many businesses.

Some recent websites I have built whilst working for a <a href="https://relativemarketing.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading Bolton marketing agency</a> include companies such as <a href="https://stanmoreinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanmore Insurance</a>, <a href="https://paulreeveslondon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Reeves London</a> and <a href="https://longleigh.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longleigh Foundation</a>.

## A clear and straight forward service

Throughout the website design and development journey I take the time to understand you, your needs and the needs of your customer to produce a website that works.

I make the website development process clear and straight forward. And, I don’t confuse people with fancy jargon.

## Sending the right message

How many times over the next few years will a potential customer visit your website and ask “Is this the right company for me?” How many times will they say yes? 

## A good website developer will create a website that converts more visitors into customers.

Throughout my career I have learnt what works and what doesn’t in the world of websites, how creating a website that looks nice is only half the battle and how important it is to send the right message to potential customers.

A good website developer will build a website that monitors the effectiveness of your website and will work with you to make continuous improvements. If you want a website that speaks to your customers and gets customers speaking to you, book a free consultation to learn more about what I can do for you.
